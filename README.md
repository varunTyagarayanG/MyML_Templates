# How to Use These Templates

## This Repository Contains Example Datasets

- **Note**: These datasets might not be real or large enough to draw conclusions from. They are provided **just for practice purposes**.

## Regression & Classification

### 1. Ensure the Data is Clean
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Remove all non-categorical variables.
  - Ensure that the dependent variable column is at the end.
  - If not, modify the code to correctly identify categorical and dependent variables.

### 2. Modify File Names
- **File Names**:
  - Simply change the name of the file in the regression and classification files.
  - You will get a confusion matrix and accuracy score as output.

### 3. About Data Preprocessing
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - This file contains all the basics with detailed commented explanations:
    1. Filling empty cells with appropriate data.
    2. Encoding data (for both dependent and independent data).
    3. Standard Scaling.

The model with the highest R-Square value for Regression and accuracy score for classification is the one you are searching for. Make sure to use a large dataset to get more precise results.

## All Other Models

- **Note**:
  - These codes are specific to the dataset.
  - It is recommended to go through the code and understand it.
  - Focus on the algorithm used in the code.
  - Once you understand that part, you can start building your model with the same algorithm!
